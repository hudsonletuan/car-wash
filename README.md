# Car Wash Simulation

You've been contracted to write a simulation to help a local car wash with their
business plan. The machine they operate for the automated car wash has various
settings that affect the speed with which a car is washed and the amount of
water and soap that are consumed. The company wants to know how many customers
they can serve and how long they will have to wait in line.

The program specifications are as follows. The program has three input items:
1. The amount of time it takes to wash one car, in seconds
2. The probability that a new customer arrives during any given second
3. The total length of time to be simulated, in seconds

The program produces two outputs, based on its computations:
1. The number of customers served during the simulation time
2. The average waiting time for customers during the simulation, in seconds
